## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for VoidRay Games

### 🎮 **Game Development Security**

#### **Asset Security**
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Validate asset paths
def load_secure_asset(asset_path):
    # Prevent directory traversal attacks
    if ".." in asset_path or asset_path.startswith("/"):
        raise SecurityError("Invalid asset path")
    
    return voidray.asset_loader.load(f"assets/{asset_path}")

# ❌ BAD: Direct user input to file paths
# asset = voidray.asset_loader.load(user_input)  # Dangerous!
```

#### **Input Validation**
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Validate and sanitize input
def handle_player_name(name_input):
    # Limit length and characters
    if len(name_input) > 50:
        name_input = name_input[:50]
    
    # Remove potentially dangerous characters
    safe_name = ''.join(c for c in name_input if c.isalnum() or c in ' -_')
    return safe_name

# ❌ BAD: Direct use of user input
# player.name = user_input  # Could contain malicious data
```

#### **Save Game Security**
```python
import json
import hashlib

# ✅ GOOD: Secure save data with integrity checks
def save_game_secure(save_data, filename):
    # Create hash for integrity
    data_json = json.dumps(save_data)
    data_hash = hashlib.sha256(data_json.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    secure_save = {
        'data': save_data,
        'hash': data_hash,
        'version': voidray.__version__
    }
    
    with open(f"saves/{filename}.json", 'w') as f:
        json.dump(secure_save, f)

def load_game_secure(filename):
    with open(f"saves/{filename}.json", 'r') as f:
        save_file = json.load(f)
    
    # Verify integrity
    data_json = json.dumps(save_file['data'])
    expected_hash = hashlib.sha256(data_json.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    if save_file['hash'] != expected_hash:
        raise SecurityError("Save file has been tampered with!")
    
    return save_file['data']
```

### 🌐 **Network Security (for multiplayer games)**

#### **Server Communication**
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Validate server responses
def handle_server_message(message):
    # Validate message structure
    required_fields = ['type', 'data', 'timestamp']
    if not all(field in message for field in required_fields):
        return False
    
    # Validate data types
    if not isinstance(message['type'], str):
        return False
    
    # Process safely
    return process_validated_message(message)

# ❌ BAD: Trust all server data
# exec(server_message['code'])  # NEVER DO THIS!
```

### 🔐 **Data Protection**

#### **Sensitive Information**
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Keep sensitive data secure
class SecurePlayerData:
    def __init__(self):
        self._high_score = 0
        self._achievements = []
    
    def get_high_score(self):
        return self._high_score
    
    def update_score(self, new_score):
        # Validate score is reasonable
        if 0 <= new_score <= 999999:
            self._high_score = max(self._high_score, new_score)

# ❌ BAD: Expose sensitive data
# player.high_score = 999999  # Easy to cheat
```

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### 🎮 **Engine-Level Security**

#### **File System Access**
- VoidRay automatically sandboxes file access to the game directory
- Asset loading is restricted to the `assets/` folder by default
- Save files are isolated to the `saves/` directory

#### **Memory Safety**
- Python's memory management provides protection against buffer overflows
- Asset loading includes size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Automatic garbage collection prevents most memory leaks

#### **Input Handling**
- All input is sanitized before processing
- Key combinations are validated to prevent system-level shortcuts
- Mouse and controller input is range-checked

### ⚠️ **Potential Risks & Mitigations**

| Risk | Mitigation | Developer Action |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Malicious Assets** | File type validation | Validate all user-provided assets |
| **Save File Tampering** | Integrity checks | Implement save data validation |
| **Code Injection** | Input sanitization | Never execute user input as code |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Resource limits | Implement reasonable limits |
| **Directory Traversal** | Path validation | Validate all file paths |
